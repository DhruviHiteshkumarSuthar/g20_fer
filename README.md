# Face Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning

A real-time face emotion recognition system that detects human emotions from live video using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and AWS Cloud Deployment.

## Features:
 1. Real-time emotion detection from camera feed.
 2. Uses CNN+RNN model for accurate emotion classification.
 3. Supports seven emotions: Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Fearful, Disgusted, Surprised.
 4. Deployed on AWS EC2 with Docker & Ansible automation.
 5. CI/CD pipeline for automated model updates.
